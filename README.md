# Sofunto Font

This font started with a copy of the Ubunto Light font. So far all of the english upper and lower case letter have been changed. Most of the changes have been rounding the hard corners. Some letters have been completely redisgned and are very different to the original. The spacing between each letter has been much reduced from the original.

Remaining tasks

- Modify the numbers 0 to 9.
- Modify the puctuation characters.
